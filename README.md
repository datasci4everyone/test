# test

This is my test repo. 

*I will use this for demonstrating various STATS 220 related teaching things.*

Are you one of my students?

- Feel free to follow me ([datasci4everyone](https://github.com/datasci4everyone))

- You can even ⭐ the repo if you want 

You can also check out my [test website!](https://datasci4everyone.github.io/test/)

This README file is intentionally boring. It could probably do with some images, or more emoji 😺
